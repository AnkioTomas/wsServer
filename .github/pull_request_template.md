** Notice: Before submitting your PR please read this! **

Does your PR add a feature?
If so:
- Is it trivial? (i.e., less than 30 loc), is it necessary? If yes, please 
send it (it's not a guarantee of merge... if you're unsure, create an issue).
- Isn't it trivial? **create an issue first**, I don't want to waste yours 
and my time... Many features may sound interesting to the user, but it is 
always important to discuss with the maintainer the viability of such a 
feature before submitting code that runs the risk of not being accepted

Does your PR fix a bug?
If so:
- Is it trivial? (i.e., less than 30 lines), please send it, bug fixes are 
always *very welcome*.
- Isn't it trivial? **create an issue first**. If the problem in question is 
not simple to solve and there may be many ways to approach the same problem, 
create an issue first.

Generally, for small PRs, discussions can occur directly within the PR 
without causing unnecessary delays for everyone. It's worth noting that 
whether a PR is considered trivial or not is also up to the contributor's 
judgment. In essence, a trivial PR is something straightforward to implement 
and review. Exercise good judgment in this regard, and thank you sincerely =).
